This project is a simple parser used for the purpose of determining the search
rankings of a webpage, given a specific keyword to search through. The search
rankings will be for google, yahoo and bing (the big three search engines in
Nort America).

This project would not be possible, except by the help of Stephen from 
netinstructions.com. Find the base project that I have used there:
