This project is a simple parser used for the purpose of determining the search
rankings of a webpage, given a specific keyword to search through. The search
rankings will be for google, yahoo and bing (the big three search engines in
North America).

This project would not be possible, except by the help of Stephen from 
netinstructions.com. Find the base project that I have used there:

Also, a warm thank you for the awesome people over at jsoup who created
the package that made everything in this possible! Visit http://jsoup.org/ for more details
